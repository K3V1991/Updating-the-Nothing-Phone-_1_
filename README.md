## Install via Local System Update:

Note: You can also use an Activity Launcher App to execute the "OfflineOTAUpgrade" Tool. The Package Name is "com.nothing.OfflineOTAUpgradeApp".

A simple Way to check if you have followed all of these steps correctly and sideload the OTA File properly is to head to Settings > About phone > Software info. <br />
This should be on the exact Nothing OS Version that you have sideloaded, indicating that youâ€™ve successfully managed to complete the Installation Process.
